## hardware-wiring
# how it works
We used four sensors: sound sensor, light sensor, heartbeat measurement sensor and movement sensor. Connect these four sensors to the Raspberry Pi, and upload the data from the sensors to the Raspberry Pi through the iic interface on the Raspberry Pi. Then use our algorithm to calculate this data on the Raspberry Pi, and then get the sleep quality score. We also set up a set of servers and a mysql database. We upload the sensor data collected by the Raspberry Pi and the calculated sleep quality score to the mysql database through the interface. The server obtains the data in the database and displays it on a web page. The above processes are all real-time, and users can obtain various data and sleep quality scores during their sleep through this web page.(http://78.141.235.21/rtshow3.html)

Here is a working demonstration of the system:

# assessment methodology
According to polysomnography (PSG), we are able to do a sleep study by monitoring or recording bio-physiological changes that occur in the human body when the person is asleep. Based on data collected during sleep, like brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity and heart rhythm, doctors are allowed to diagnose whether patients are suffering from sleep disorders or not.

Although PSG is regarded as a gold rule for sleep research, it also has many drawbacks. For example, people are normally subject to the equipments which are used for collecting data so that they are unlikely to conduct a PSG test at home or even cannot collect reliable data. In addition to this, PSG scoring also usually varies from laboratory to laboratory. Because of those drawbacks, it is obvious that we cannot implement the whole PSG standard on our device directly. Therefore we refer to some other researches, like Sleep Evaluation by Actigraphy and A novel approach using actigraphy to quantify the level of disruption of sleep by in-home ploysomnography etc, and combine those references, then, come up with a assessment.
Here, assessment as follows:

* Sleep latency (20 minutes or less), the moment an individual slept since the lights were switched off.

* Sleep efficiency, which is the minutes of total sleep divided by the minutes spent on bed. In normal cases, it falls between 85%-90%.

* Sleep stages, which are based on the data coming from various kinds of sensors, like sound sensors, light sensors, motion sensors as well as heart rhythm sensors.

# data visualization example
By using mysql database, the local Raspberry Pi can connect and push the data to the database, and the website can grabbing and showing the data in properly way to the user.

The site is based on *Ubuntu Linux* system, *Apache* server, *MySQL* database and most of pages are wrriten by *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* and *PHP*. *jQuery* and *Chart.js* are also being used for efficiency and goodlooking.

Here is an example page for what data will be showing: http://78.141.235.21/rtshow.html

~~It may took around 5 seconds to showing, better viewing implementation is developing by team member.~~

Better view has been implemented. the page will showing data when the page finished load and update the data every 5 seconds. Chart will transform smoothly.
